## Overview of Project

### Background/Purpose
This week after editing a workbook for Steve. He is now wants an additioinal request. The purpose of this request/chalelnge is to provide Steve with a dataset that will review an entire stock market over the last few years by using code. To complete this request coding will need to be utalized. In addition, an analysis of the findings will be provided to showcase the results that Steve may be looking for.  


## Results
From the data obtained the majority of the stockings in 2017 had a greater return than the next year in 2018. In 2017, 4 markets had a return value over 100% and the lowest posstive return value was at 5.5%. Only one market had a negative return value in 2017. In 2018 no one did as great.

Within the past week I have seen the advantantages and disadanvages of refactorting code. The disadvantages of refactoring code is trying to figure out what the other person was leading to to complete the code and which code should be used in general. Some advantages are that if you do refactor the code properly you can sort through thousands of data by recoding the data.

Within the past week I have seen the advantantages and disadanvages of original and refactored VCA script. The avdantages of Original VBA script is knowing the direction you are coding. The disadvantages of refactored VBA script is trying to decode the previous work and determine the next steps for the data/code needed.
